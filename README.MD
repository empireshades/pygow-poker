## Game Rules

Pai Gow Poker is an engaging table game inspired by the Chinese domino game Pai Gow. It is played with a 53 card deck (standard 52 cards + one joker) with the players trying to beat the dealer. After bets are made, 7 cards are dealt to each participant where they need to be split into a 5 card "high" poker hand and a 2 card "low" poker hand. [Standard poker rankings](https://www.poker.org/poker-hands-ranking-chart/) apply when setting the cards where the single joker acts as a wild when completing a straight or a flush otherwise it acts as an ace. **The high hand must beat the low hand** when setting the cards. Once all hands are set and revealed, three possible outcomes can occur:

1. Both player hands beat both dealer hands results in a win (doubles bet)
2. Both dealer hands beat both player hands results in a loss (lose bet)
3. The player beats one dealer hand and loses the other results in a push (tie)
